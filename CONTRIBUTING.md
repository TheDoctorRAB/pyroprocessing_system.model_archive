# Contributing to the pyroprocessing system model

## Level of expertise

## Types of contributions
1. Reporting issues
2. Requesting features
3. Modifications to the existing model if level of expertise is met  
- Physics modeling  
- Electrochemical modeling  
- DES  
- Statistical modeling

4. Process documentation

## Notes on issues
Report an [issue](https://github.com/TheDoctorRAB/pyroprocessing_system.model/issues) if something in the code looks wrong, or if there is a potentially useful feature to add to the model. We're particularly interested in making sure the code is well-commented. 

1. Make sure your proposed issue hasn't already been posted. 
2. Comment on any existing issues. 
3. Be as clear as possible in describing an issue.

## Contributor workflow

This project is based on the [Integrator Workflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrator_workflow) concept. 

To contribute to this project:
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project to your own github. 
2. Follow a [branching workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows) style.  
3. Sync your master branch with the upstream master (this one). 
4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your new contribution for review.

## Review criteria

All pull requests will be reviewed for style, commenting, physics, math, output presentation, etc. 

The reviewer will:

- Examine the pull request for adherence to style and content requirements.
- Add comments for revising the pull request. 
- 'Merge Pull Request' if all criteria are statisfied.
